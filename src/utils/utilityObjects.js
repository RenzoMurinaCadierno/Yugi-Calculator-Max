        Hey there! If you are seeing this, then an error has been triggered
        somewhere in the app.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since this is not a case-specific kind of error *lazydevcough*, I cannot
        promise you the app will function properly.
      </p>
      <p>But alas, let me give you a couple of recommendations:</p>

      <ul>
        <li> Ol' reliable: reset the app. </li>
        <li>
          Check your internet connection and try loading the whole app (swipe
          through all pages) while online.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you are using the downloaded app version in your cellphone, try
          deleting and reinstalling it from scratch.
        </li>
        <li>If nothing works, hmm... Try playing some Pokemon TCG?</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Please, the developer would be glad if you keep in touch to show this
        and explain it in detail. That would certainly help tackle the issue.
      </p>
      <p>
        Or to throw all this aside and play some Pokemon. That would be a neat
        alternative.
      </p>
